        <p>Hi, my name is Ella and Iâ€™m a junior at Syracuse University studying <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> in the iSchool. I intended to concentrate in information security and minor in <strong>Jewelry and Metalsmithing</strong> in the School of Art. I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in 2017 where I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also worked with Scratch and other coding platforms. In Syracuse, I run a Girls Who Code afterschool club at an afterschool center that helps Syrian and Somalian refugee children succeed in school. I am also a member of &Sigma;&Delta;&Tau;.</p>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>Outside of school I like to bake and do crafts. I enjoy comedy specials and crime shows. </p>
