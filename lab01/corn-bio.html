        Ella Corn
        Hi, my name is Ella and Iâ€™m a junior studying information management and technology in the iSchool. I intended to concentrate in information security and minor in jewelry and metalsmithing in the School of Art. I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in 2017 where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. We also worked with Scratch and other coding platforms. In Syracuse, I run a Girls Who Code afterschool club at an afterschool center that helps Syrian and Somalian refugee children succeed in school. Outside of school I like to bake and do crafts. I enjoy comedy specials and crime shows.
